# Surveyor

Surveyor is a web application used by business owners to mass email surveys to their consumers and collect data, which is organized in statistical graphs. In order to send out surveys, users must purchase credits that allow them to send out surveys. After the surveys are sent out, the survey information and collected data is neatly displayed on the dashboard for the user's convenience.
